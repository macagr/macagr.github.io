### About RandomByte's Security Journey

I always like comparing the learning process to a journey: we may know or not our goal, but getting there is always full of unexpected surprises and new things to learn or check out. In this blog I will mainly compile thoughts, learnings, and different perspectives that I have developed through my (at the moment, short) journey into information security. Feel free to contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ACyberPotato) if you have any suggestions about what I am writing here!

### About me 
I am a pentester and cybersecurity consultant aiming to learn about the more offensive side of security. I love learning and writing, which is one of the reasons I decided to create this blog. In here, I will be trying to compile all the new cool things I learn, both as a test of my own understanding and to polish my writing skills.
